# Default vs Named Exports

👨‍💼 Perfect! You've used both named and default exports. Notice how you can
import both in a single statement.

🦉 **Use named exports when:**

- Exporting multiple things from a module
- You want explicit names at the import site
- Better for tree-shaking

**Use default exports when:**

- Exporting a single primary thing (like a class or main function)
- The module has one clear purpose
- Common in React components
