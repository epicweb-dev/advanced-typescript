# Type-Only Imports

👨‍💼 Perfect! You've organized your types into a separate module. Notice how
TypeScript understands the types across module boundaries.

🦉 When importing types, you can use `import type` for type-only imports:

```ts
import type { User } from './types.ts' // Type-only import
```

Ultimately it's the same with modern tools.
