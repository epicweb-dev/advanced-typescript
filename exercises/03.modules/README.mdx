# Modules

ES modules are the standard way to organize and share code in modern JavaScript
and TypeScript. They let you split code into separate files and import/export
functionality between them.

```ts
// user.ts
export const user = { id: 'u1', name: 'Ada' }
export function getDisplayName(user: { name: string }) {
	return user.name
}

// main.ts
import { user, getDisplayName } from './user.ts'
```

## Module Benefits

- **Organization** - Split code into logical files
- **Reusability** - Share code across files
- **Encapsulation** - Control what's public vs private
- **Tree-shaking** - Bundlers can eliminate unused code

<callout-info>
	TypeScript fully supports ES modules. Use `import` and `export` statements,
	and TypeScript will handle type checking across module boundaries.
</callout-info>

In this exercise, you'll organize code using modules, understand the
difference between default and named exports, and practice type-only imports.
