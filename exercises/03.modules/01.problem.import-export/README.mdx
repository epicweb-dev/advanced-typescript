# Import and Export

👨‍💼 Our code is getting large. Let's split it into separate modules to keep
things organized.

🐨 Create a new file `types.ts` and:

1. Move the `User` and `Product` types to `types.ts`
2. Export them using named exports
3. Import them in `index.ts`

<callout-info>
	When importing **types only** (not values), use `import { type X }` syntax.
	This tells TypeScript (and Node.js) that these imports are purely for type
	checking and should be erased at runtime. This is required when running
	TypeScript natively with Node.js.
