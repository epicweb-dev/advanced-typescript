# Promise Types

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/advanced-typescript/2-async-await/promise-types" />

👨‍💼 Perfect! Notice how TypeScript infers that `user` is of type `User` and
`products` is of type `Array<Product>` after awaiting. The type system understands
that `await` unwraps the Promise.

🦉 Explicit return type annotations on async functions are especially helpful
when:

- The function body is complex
- You want to document the contract
- You're creating a library API

TypeScript will still infer types, but explicit annotations make your code
self-documenting.
