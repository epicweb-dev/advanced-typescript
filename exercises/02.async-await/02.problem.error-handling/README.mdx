# Error Handling with Async/Await

👨‍💼 Our async code needs proper error handling. Let's use try/catch to handle
failures gracefully.

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Wrap the async operations in a `try` block
2. Add a `catch` block to handle errors
3. Optionally add a `finally` block for cleanup
