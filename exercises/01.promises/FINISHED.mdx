# Promises

👨‍💼 Excellent! You now understand how to create and work with Promises.

You learned:

- 🔨 **Creating Promises** with `new Promise()`
- 🔗 **Chaining operations** with `.then()`
- ⚠️ **Error handling** with `.catch()`
- 🎯 **Type safety** with `Promise<T>` generic types

🦉 Remember: Promises are eager—they start executing immediately when created.
If you need lazy execution, wrap the Promise creation in a function.

```ts
// Eager - starts immediately
const promise = fetchData()

// Lazy - starts when function is called
const getPromise = () => fetchData()
```

Next up: Async/await—a cleaner syntax for working with Promises!
