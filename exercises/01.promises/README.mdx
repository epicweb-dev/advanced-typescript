# Promises

Promises are the foundation of asynchronous programming in JavaScript and
TypeScript. They represent a value that will be available in the future—either
a successful result or a failure.

```ts
// A Promise that resolves to a string
const fetchUser = (): Promise<string> => {
	return new Promise((resolve) => {
		setTimeout(() => resolve('Alice'), 1000)
	})
}
```

## Why Promises Matter

- **Error handling** - `.catch()` handles failures gracefully
- **Chaining** - `.then()` chains operations together
- **Composition** - Combine multiple async operations
- **Type safety** - TypeScript ensures you handle the right types

```ts
fetchUser()
	.then((name) => console.log(name))
	.catch((error) => console.error(error))
```

	Promises are everywhere in modern JavaScript. Understanding them deeply is
	essential for working with APIs, file operations, timers, and any async code.

In this exercise, you'll create Promises and chain them together to handle
realistic async scenarios.
