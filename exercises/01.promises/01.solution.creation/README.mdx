# Creating Promises

👨‍💼 Great! You've created your first Promise. Notice how TypeScript ensures
the resolved value matches the `User` type.

🦉 Promises start executing immediately when created. If you want to delay
execution, wrap the Promise creation in a function (like we did here).

<callout-info>
	Notice the `void` keyword before `fetchUser().then(...)`. This tells
	TypeScript we're intentionally ignoring the Promise's result. Without it,
	TypeScript's `no-floating-promises` rule would warn us about an unhandled
	Promise. Using `void` is the clean way to say "I know this returns a Promise,
	and I'm choosing not to await or handle it."
</callout-info>

Next, let's chain multiple Promises together!
