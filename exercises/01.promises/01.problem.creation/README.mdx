# Creating Promises

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/advanced-typescript/1-promises/creation" />

👨‍💼 We need to simulate an API call that fetches user data. Let's create a
Promise that resolves with user information after a delay.

```ts
type Forecast = { day: string; high: number }

const fetchForecast = () =>
	new Promise<Forecast>((resolve) => {
		setTimeout(() => resolve({ day: 'Mon', high: 72 }), 500)
	})
```

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Create a `fetchUser` function that returns a `Promise<User>`
2. The Promise should resolve after 1 second with a user object (you could do 10 milliseconds to make the tests faster if you want)
3. The user object should have: `id: string`, `name: string`, `email: string`
