# Creating Promises

👨‍💼 We need to simulate an API call that fetches user data. Let's create a
Promise that resolves with user information after a delay.

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Create a `fetchUser` function that returns a `Promise<User>`
2. The Promise should resolve after 1 second with a user object
3. The user object should have: `id: string`, `name: string`, `email: string`

💰 Use `new Promise` and `setTimeout` to simulate a delayed response.
