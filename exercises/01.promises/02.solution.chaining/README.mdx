# Chaining Promises

👨‍💼 Perfect! You've chained Promises together. Notice how each `.then()`
receives the return value from the previous one, allowing you to build
complex async workflows.

🦉 When chaining Promises, always return a value from `.then()` if you want
the next `.then()` to receive it. If you don't return, the next `.then()`
receives `undefined`.
