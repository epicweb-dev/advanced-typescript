# Type Operators

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/advanced-typescript/4-type-operators/intro-to-type-operators" />

TypeScript provides operators that work on **types**, not values. These are
essential for writing type-safe, flexible code.

## The `keyof` Operator

`keyof` extracts the keys of an object type as a union:

```ts
type User = { id: string; name: string; age: number }
type UserKeys = keyof User // 'id' | 'name' | 'age'
```

## The `typeof` Operator

`typeof` extracts the type from a value:

```ts
const config = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }
type Config = typeof config // { host: string; port: number }
```

Combined with `as const`, this is powerful:

```ts
const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'] as const
type Color = (typeof colors)[number] // 'red' | 'green' | 'blue'
```

## Index Access Types

Access a property's type using bracket notation:

```ts
type User = { id: string; name: string }
type IdType = User['id'] // string
type NameOrId = User['id' | 'name'] // string (union of both)
```

	These operators are the building blocks for advanced TypeScript patterns. They
	appear in utility types, library definitions, and sophisticated generic code.

In this exercise, you'll use these operators to build type-safe utilities.
