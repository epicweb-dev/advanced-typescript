# Index Access Types

👨‍💼 You've mastered index access types!

🦉 This pattern is essential when working with:

- API responses (extracting nested types)
- Configuration objects
- Generic utilities
- Type transformations

```ts
// Real-world example: Extract types from an API response
type User = ApiResponse['data']['user']
type Post = ApiResponse['data']['posts'][number]
```

No need to manually define duplicate types—just extract what you need!
