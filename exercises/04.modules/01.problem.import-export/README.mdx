# Import and Export

👨‍💼 Our code is getting large. Let's split it into separate modules to keep
things organized.

🐨 Create a new file `types.ts` and:

1. Move the `User` and `Product` types to `types.ts`
2. Export them using named exports
3. Import them in `index.ts`

💰 Module syntax:

```ts
// types.ts
export type User = { ... }
export type Product = { ... }

// index.ts
import { type User, type Product } from './types.ts'
```

<callout-info>
	When importing **types only** (not values), use `import { type X }` syntax.
	This tells TypeScript (and Node.js) that these imports are purely for type
	checking and should be erased at runtime. This is required when running
	TypeScript natively with Node.js.

🐨 Once you've completed the exercise, run `node index.ts` in the playground to test your work!
