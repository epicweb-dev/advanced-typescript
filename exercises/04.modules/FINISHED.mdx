# Modules

👨‍💼 Excellent! You now understand how to organize code with modules.

You learned:

- 📦 **Exporting** types, functions, and values
- 📥 **Importing** from other modules
- 🎯 **Named exports** for multiple exports
- ⭐ **Default exports** for single primary exports
- 🔗 **Type-only imports** for better tree-shaking

🦉 A common pattern is to have an `index.ts` file that re-exports everything
from a module:

```ts
// user/index.ts
export * from './types'
export * from './functions'
```

This creates a clean public API for your module.
