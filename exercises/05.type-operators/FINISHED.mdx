# Type Operators

👨‍💼 You've mastered TypeScript's type operators!

You learned:

- 🔑 **`keyof`** extracts property keys as a union
- 📋 **`typeof`** extracts types from values
- 🔍 **Index access** gets property types with `T['prop']`
- 🔒 **`as const`** preserves literal types

🦉 These operators combine powerfully:

```ts
const routes = {
	home: '/',
	about: '/about',
	users: '/users',
} as const

type RouteKey = keyof typeof routes // 'home' | 'about' | 'users'
type RoutePath = (typeof routes)[RouteKey] // '/' | '/about' | '/users'
```

This pattern is used everywhere: configuration objects, event maps, action
types, and more.
