# keyof and typeof

👨‍💼 You've used type operators to extract and work with types!

🦉 The `as const` trick is essential for deriving literal union types from
arrays:

```ts
// Without as const
const colors = ['red', 'blue'] // string[]
type Color = (typeof colors)[number] // string 😢

// With as const
const colors = ['red', 'blue'] as const // readonly ['red', 'blue']
type Color = (typeof colors)[number] // 'red' | 'blue' 🎉
```

This pattern is used everywhere for configuration and constants.
