# Advanced TypeScript

👨‍💼 Congratulations! You've completed the Advanced TypeScript workshop! 🎉

You've mastered production-ready TypeScript patterns:

- **Promises & Async/Await** for clean asynchronous code
- **Modules** for organizing and sharing code
- **Utility types** including `Partial`, `Pick`, `Omit`, `ReturnType`, and more
- **Type operators** like `keyof`, `typeof`, and index access
- **Mapped types** for creating type transformations
- **Conditional types** for type-level logic
- **Code organization** patterns that scale

📝 Reflect on what you learned:

- How do `keyof` and `typeof` help create type-safe code?
- How do mapped types power built-in utilities like `Partial`?
- When would you use conditional types with `infer`?
- How can these advanced patterns improve your codebase?

🦉 **Key insight**: TypeScript isn't just about catching errors—it's about
designing code that's maintainable at scale. The patterns you've learned here
will help you write TypeScript that survives real-world complexity.

## You've Completed the Course! 🎉

You now have comprehensive TypeScript knowledge:

1. **Foundations** - Values, control flow, functions
2. **Structured Data** - Objects, arrays, tuples
3. **Type Safety** - Unions, generics, type guards
4. **OOP** - Classes, inheritance, polymorphism
5. **Advanced** - Async, modules, advanced types

Keep building and exploring! 🚀
