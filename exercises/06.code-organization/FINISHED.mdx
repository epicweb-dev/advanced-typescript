# Code Organization

👨‍💼 Excellent! You've learned how to organize TypeScript code for scale.

You learned:

- 🏗️ **Boundaries** - Separating concerns into modules
- 📦 **Barrel exports** - Creating clean public APIs
- 🎯 **Feature organization** - Grouping related code together
- 📝 **Type organization** - Keeping types with their domains

🦉 As your project grows, consider:

- **Co-location** - Keep related code together
- **Barrel files** - Use `index.ts` to control what's exported
- **Consistency** - Pick patterns and stick with them
- **Documentation** - Add README files for complex modules

Good organization is an investment that pays off as your codebase grows!
