# Code Organization

As TypeScript projects grow, organizing code becomes critical. Good organization
makes code maintainable, discoverable, and scalable.

## Organization Patterns

- **Feature-based** - Group by feature/domain
- **Layer-based** - Group by technical layer (types, utils, services)
- **Barrel exports** - Use `index.ts` to create clean public APIs
- **Type boundaries** - Separate types from implementation

```ts
// Feature-based structure
src/
  users/
    types.ts
    api.ts
    index.ts  // Barrel export
  products/
    types.ts
    api.ts
    index.ts
```

There's no one "right" way to organize code. Choose patterns that fit your
team and project size. The key is consistency.

In this exercise, you'll organize code using boundaries and barrel exports
to create a maintainable structure.
