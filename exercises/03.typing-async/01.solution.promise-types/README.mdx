# Promise Types

👨‍💼 Perfect! Notice how TypeScript infers that `user` is of type `User` and
`products` is of type `Product[]` after awaiting. The type system understands
that `await` unwraps the Promise.

🦉 Explicit return type annotations on async functions are especially helpful
when:
- The function body is complex
- You want to document the contract
- You're creating a library API

TypeScript will still infer types, but explicit annotations make your code
self-documenting.
