# Module Boundaries

👨‍💼 Perfect! You've organized the code into clear module boundaries. Notice
how the barrel exports (`index.ts`) create a clean public API for each module.

🦉 This organization pattern:

- **Separates concerns** - Each module has a single responsibility
- **Creates boundaries** - Clear interfaces between modules
- **Enables reuse** - Modules can be imported independently
- **Scales well** - Easy to add new features without cluttering

You've completed the Advanced TypeScript workshop! 🎉
