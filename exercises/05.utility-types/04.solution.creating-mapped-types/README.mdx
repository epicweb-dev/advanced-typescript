# Creating Mapped Types

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/advanced-typescript/utility-types/creating-mapped-types" />

👨‍💼 You've recreated TypeScript's utility types from scratch!

🦉 Key insights:

- `?` adds optional, `-?` removes it
- `readonly` adds readonly, `-readonly` removes it
- `T[K]` gives you the original type to transform

These patterns are used in advanced libraries like Prisma, tRPC, and Zod.
