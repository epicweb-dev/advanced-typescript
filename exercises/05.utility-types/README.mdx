# Utility Types

TypeScript provides powerful utility types that let you transform and manipulate
types. These built-in helpers reduce boilerplate and make your types more
expressive.

```ts
type User = { id: string; name: string; email: string }

// Make all properties optional
type PartialUser = Partial<User>
// { id?: string; name?: string; email?: string }

// Pick specific properties
type UserPreview = Pick<User, 'id' | 'name'>
// { id: string; name: string }
```

## Common Utility Types

- **Partial** - Makes all properties optional
- **Required** - Makes all properties required
- **Pick** - Selects specific properties
- **Omit** - Removes specific properties
- **Record** - Creates an object type with specific keys
- **Readonly** - Makes all properties readonly

Utility types are type-level functions. They take types as input and produce
new types as output, enabling powerful type transformations without runtime
overhead.

In this exercise, you'll use utility types to transform and manipulate types
efficiently.
