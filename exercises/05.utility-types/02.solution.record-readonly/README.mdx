# Record and Readonly

👨‍💼 Excellent! You've used `Record` to create a flexible config type and
`Readonly` to prevent mutations. Notice how TypeScript prevents you from
modifying the readonly user.

🦉 `Record` is especially useful when you know the key type but not the
specific keys. `Readonly` helps prevent accidental mutations, which is
important for immutability patterns.

You've now mastered the most common utility types!
