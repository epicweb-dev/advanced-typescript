👨‍💼 Excellent! You've mastered TypeScript's utility types.

You learned:

- 🔧 **Partial** - Making properties optional
- 🎯 **Pick** - Selecting specific properties
- 📝 **Record** - Creating key-value types
- 🔒 **Readonly** - Making properties immutable
- 🧩 **Composition** - Combining utility types
- 🗺️ **Mapped Types** - Creating custom utilities

🦉 Utility types are composable. You can combine them:

```ts
type UserUpdate = Partial<Pick<User, 'name' | 'email'>>
// Makes only name and email optional
```

This pattern is common in APIs where you want to update specific fields.

Next up: Conditional types!
