# Conditional Types

👨‍💼 You've learned type-level programming with conditional types!

You learned:

- ❓ **Conditionals** with `T extends U ? A : B`
- 🔮 **`infer`** to extract types from patterns
- 🔍 **Filtering unions** with distributed conditionals
- 🛠️ **Building utilities** like `ReturnType` and `Awaited`

🦉 Conditional types power many advanced patterns:

```ts
// TypeScript's built-in NonNullable
type NonNullable<T> = T extends null | undefined ? never : T

// TypeScript's built-in ReturnType
type ReturnType<T> = T extends (...args: any[]) => infer R ? R : any

// TypeScript's built-in Awaited
type Awaited<T> = T extends Promise<infer U> ? Awaited<U> : T
```

You now have the tools to understand and create advanced TypeScript patterns!

🎉 Congratulations on completing these advanced topics!
