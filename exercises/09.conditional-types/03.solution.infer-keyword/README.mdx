# The infer Keyword

👨‍💼 You've mastered `infer` for type extraction!

🦉 These patterns power real-world TypeScript:

```ts
// Get the props type from a React component
type ComponentProps<T> = T extends React.ComponentType<infer P> ? P : never

// Extract the type a function was called with
type InstanceType<T> = T extends new (...args: Array<any>) => infer R
	? R
	: never

// Get all values from an object type
type ValueOf<T> = T[keyof T]
```

You now have deep understanding of TypeScript's type system!
