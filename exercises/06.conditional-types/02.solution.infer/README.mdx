# Introduction to infer

🦉 Great work! You've learned the fundamental `infer` patterns:

- `Array<infer E>` - Extract array element type
- `Promise<infer U>` - Extract promise resolved type
- `(...args: Array<any>) => infer R` - Extract function return type

These patterns form the building blocks for TypeScript's built-in utility types
like `ReturnType<T>` and `Awaited<T>`.
