# Basic Conditionals

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/advanced-typescript/6-conditional-types/basic-conditionals" />

👨‍💼 You've created type-level conditionals!

🦉 Notice how `Flatten` uses `infer`:

```ts
type Flatten<T> = T extends Array<infer U> ? U : T
```

This pattern says: "If T is an array of something, call that something U and
return it. Otherwise, return T."

This is exactly how TypeScript extracts types from complex structures.
