👨‍💼 Welcome to Advanced TypeScript! This workshop takes you beyond the basics
into **production-ready TypeScript patterns** that scale.

In this workshop, you'll master:

1. **Promises** - Handling asynchronous operations with proper typing
2. **Async/Await** - Writing clean asynchronous code with typed returns
3. **Modules** - Organizing code with ES modules and TypeScript
4. **Type Operators** - Using `keyof`, `typeof`, and index access types
5. **Utility Types** - Using built-ins and creating your own
6. **Conditional Types** - Types that depend on conditions

<callout-info>
	This workshop focuses on real-world scenarios. You'll work with API calls,
	data fetching, file operations, and other practical async patterns you'll
	encounter in production codebases.
</callout-info>

By the end of this workshop, you'll be able to:

- Write type-safe asynchronous code with Promises and async/await
- Properly type async functions and their return values
- Organize code using ES modules and TypeScript module resolution
- Use type operators to derive types from values
- Use utility types to transform and manipulate types
- Create custom mapped and conditional types

Let's build TypeScript code that survives the real world! 🚀
