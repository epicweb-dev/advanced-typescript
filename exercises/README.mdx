# Advanced TypeScript 🚀

👨‍💼 Welcome to Advanced TypeScript! This workshop takes you beyond the basics
into **production-ready TypeScript patterns** that scale.

In this workshop, you'll master:

1. **Promises** - Handling asynchronous operations with proper typing
2. **Async/Await** - Writing clean asynchronous code
3. **Typing Async Code** - Making async operations type-safe
4. **Modules** - Organizing code with ES modules and TypeScript
5. **Utility Types** - Leveraging TypeScript's built-in type helpers
6. **Code Organization** - Structuring large TypeScript projects

<callout-info>
This workshop focuses on real-world scenarios. You'll work with API calls, data
fetching, file operations, and other practical async patterns you'll encounter
in production codebases.

By the end of this workshop, you'll be able to:

- Write type-safe asynchronous code with Promises and async/await
- Properly type async functions and their return values
- Organize code using ES modules and TypeScript module resolution
- Use utility types to transform and manipulate types
- Structure large TypeScript projects for maintainability

Let's build TypeScript code that survives the real world! 🚀
