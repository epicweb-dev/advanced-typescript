# Focus Timer

This extra is a real-world React + Vite app where you will apply everything
from the Advanced TypeScript workshop. The app runs with placeholder logic, and
you will implement the utilities that make it fully functional.

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="src/utils.ts" /> and implement every type and function
marked with 🐨.

🐨 Then open <InlineFile file="src/app.tsx" /> and use your utilities where
marked with 🐨.

## Running the app

```sh
npm run dev
```

The app should load without changes. As you implement the utilities, the UI
will become more accurate and interactive.
