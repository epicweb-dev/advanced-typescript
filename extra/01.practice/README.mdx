# Advanced TypeScript Practice

This extra is a single practice file that touches every concept in this workshop.
Work through the sections in order and use TypeScript to guide you as you go.

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and follow the instructions in each
section.

🐨 Use <InlineFile file="index.data.ts" /> for the module-import exercises.

There are no tests or solutions in this section. This is focused practice.
