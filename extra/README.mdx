# Extras

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/advanced-typescript" />

These extras are here to help you practice what you have already learned in the
workshop. They focus on advanced TypeScript topics like promises, async/await,
modules, type operators, utility types, mapped types, and conditional types.

There are no solutions and no tests in this section. That is intentional. This
is about exploring, practicing, and building confidence by applying workshop
concepts to something that feels real.

You may see code that looks unfamiliar (React, Vite, styling, etc.). Feel free
to explore it, but you do not need to master it right now. Focus on the areas
with 🐨 instructions. Those are the parts that line up with what you've learned
so far.

Spaced repetition helps you remember what you learn by revisiting it over time.
Practical extras like these give you lots of reps and quick wins, which makes
the concepts stick and builds momentum.
